    "description": "Gold Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.<br><br>\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\n- Chopperman to the Rescue! Protect the TV Station by the Shore! (Episode 336)<br>\n- The Strongest Tag-Team! Luffy and Toriko's Hard Struggle! (Episode 492)<br>\n- Team Formation!

Their battle is felt shaking the Tontatta Kingdom while the dwarves believed it to be Usopp's Haki. When Usopp questions their war with Doflamingo, the dwarves thought it was a joke and explains that 500 of their people including their princess are held as slaves in Doflamingo's dark factory and their goal is to rescue them and destroy the factory revealed to be hidden in the Corrida Colosseum basement, right underneath Luffy's feet.",

Crocodile says he has no more interest in the country of Arabasta. Ivankov accepts his offer, telling all of them that he knows a weakness of Crocodile. Then, from behind, Jinbei asks Luffy if he could join too, willing to sacrifice himself to rescue Ace. Inazuma opens up their handcuffs with his powers, and the two are out.\nThe five prisoners get up to level 5, using Crocodile's ability. They gather the New Kama army (including Mr. 2 Bon Kurei).

As the guards are down, Crocodile heads up in the direction of one particular cell, the one holding his former subordinate, Mr. 1. Meanwhile, Ace is already on the Marine warship, being transferred to his execution ground. Also, Buggy and Mr. 3 are hiding at level 2.",

Midway, Sanji and Zoro seize him, put him into the Franky Family's shoot-anything-cannon, and have him shot in front of the new ship.",

He spins around until his leg starts glowing red with heat, and defeats Jyabura in a fierce mid-air final.",
